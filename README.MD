# Learning Rust ðŸ¦€

So yeah... apparently C++ wasnâ€™t hard enough,  
so now Iâ€™ve decided to ruin my peace with Rust.

Because why not fight with the compiler  
and question my life choices _every single day_ like pursuing as Btechhhhh Studentttt?

Memory safety? Ownership? Borrow checker?  
Haan haan, bas yahi cheezein chahiye thi mujheâ€¦

Anyway, welcome to my journey of learning Rust.  
Expect chaos, sarcasm, and maybeâ€¦ just maybeâ€¦ some working code...
